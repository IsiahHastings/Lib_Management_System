# Library Management System

## Project Description
This project is a simple **Library Management System** built with MySQL. It allows tracking of books, authors, patrons, and book loans in a library. The system supports the following features:

- Managing books and authors (many-to-many relationship).
- Tracking patrons and their borrowed books (one-to-many relationship).
- Managing book loans and due dates.

## How to Run
1. Install MySQL on your local machine or use a cloud-based MySQL instance.
2. Create a new database for the Library Management System (e.g., `libraryDB`).
3. Import the provided `lib.sql` file to create the necessary tables and relationships.
4. Use any SQL client (like MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin) to execute queries.

## Files Included
- `lib.sql`: Contains the SQL queries to create the database, tables, and insert sample data.
- `README.md`: Provides a description of the project and setup instructions.
